<p class="center">Welcome to Enl!ghten: Kitsap Community Forum</p>

<p>
This is a group for anyone who likes to learn and to be inspired by others.
We meet the third Friday of every month, except December, and present expert guest speakers.
Presentations cover topics ranging from environmental issues, current health and scientific trends, local authors, healthy aging and well-being, to nonprofit agencies helping others locally and internationally.
We encourage discussion, sharing of experiences and volunteerism.
A great place to expand your views and meet new people in your community.
</p>

<p>
We respectfully acknowledge that we are on indigenous land, the traditional territories of the Coast Salish People.
We honor our ongoing connection to these communities past, present and future. 
<p>

Enl!ghten, a partner with Kitsap Regional Library since 2019.
