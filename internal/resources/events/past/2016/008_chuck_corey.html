Are you prepared for the Big One? <strong>Chuck Corey</strong> discussed steps involved in creating a neighborhood disaster response team. This begins with personal preparedness, expanding to family preparedness, neighborhood, then community. He is a leader in the Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) in Issaquah, WA and a facilitator in the Map Your Neighborhood (MYN) program. He has collected a great deal of information regarding surviving disasters. You can view his entire power point presentation under &#8220;Links and Resources&#8221; on this website. Detailed lists of supplies to have on hand, recommended readings and websites are presented there.
