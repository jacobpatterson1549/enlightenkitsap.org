<strong>Adrienne Hampton</strong>, the Climate Policy and Engagement Manager for the Duwamish River Community Coalition, presented on "Advancing Climate Justice to Promote Health Equity." Why do adverse climate changes and environmental disasters disproportionately affect the low income population and people of color? She addressed how this came about and what can be done to promote fairness and justice in climate and public health policies. Adrienne works at the nexus of collaborative governance and climate justice to promote public health equity. She earned her Master of Public Administration degree from the Evans School of Public Policy and Governance at the University of Washington and her Certificate in Climate Change and Health from Yale School of Public Health. Her background and career are based on ocean climate action, equity and racial justice in policy. She serves as the Climate Policy and Engagement Manager at the Duwamish River Cleanup Coalition. Her presentation is posted on our "Zoom Videos and Resources" page.
