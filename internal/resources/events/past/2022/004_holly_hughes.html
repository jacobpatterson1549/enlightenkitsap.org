<strong>Holly Hughes</strong> presented on "Turning to Poetry in Hard Times." Poetry often flourishes in times of crisis, whether a pandemic or war. The last two years brought us bothâ€”and the reading of poetry is up 30%. It's not surprising; from our earliest days, humans have turned to poetry to sustain our spirits. Poet, essayist and teacher Holly J. Hughes explored how poems offer solace and wisdom in challenging times. She discussed how poetry can heal and she shared examples of poems that can sustain us, focusing on poems by a diverse selection of contemporary poets. Visit the "Zoom Videos and Resources" page for book and resource recommendations. Her presentation will be posted there soon.
