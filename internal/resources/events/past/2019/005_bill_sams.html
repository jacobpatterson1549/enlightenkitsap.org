<strong>Bill Sams</strong> was literally at "ground zero" of the beginning years of the computer revolution when he began his career in the early 1970s at Fairchild Semiconductor. He was involved in several start-ups and chalked up 25 years in senior management positions in Silicon Valley. Following an early "retirement," he and his wife Janet sailed the South Pacific before returning to his alma mater Ohio University for an additional 10-year career in academia. Among many positions, he served as Associate Provost for Information Technology and Chief Information Officer of the university and was an "executive in residence" at its business school. He is a founding member of the Ohio Tech Angel Fund, now one of the largest angel investment groups in America. He brings both a depth of background and keen current attention to possible future tech development. He shared his impressions of the future of robotics and artificial intelligence.
