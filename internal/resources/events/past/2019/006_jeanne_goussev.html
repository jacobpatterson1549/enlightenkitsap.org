Sail Like A Girl! <strong>Jeanne Assael Goussev</strong>, Captain of the first all-women crew to win the race from Port Townsend to Victoria to Ketchikan presented to Enl!ghten. They arrived under bicycle power — two bike stations dangled off the stern that powered propellers — for a competition with the cornerstone motto "no motor, no support, all the way to Alaska." They completed the race in 6 days, 13 hours, 17 minutes. Gousseve's crew, whose average age is about 41, also consists of Aimee Fulwell, Allison Dvaladze, Kelly Adamson Danielson and Haley King Lhamon, of Bainbridge Island; and Anna Stevens, Kate Hearsey McKay and Morgana Buell, of Seattle. The team donated funds to the Pink Boat Regatta in support of the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. The crew carried the names of people they know who have been affected by breast cancer. "It helped us to dig deep to think about them," Gousseve said. "It was a wonderful way we could make this about something bigger than our own selves that was important to all of us."
