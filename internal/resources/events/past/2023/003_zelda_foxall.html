<strong>Zelda Foxall</strong> returned to Enl!ghten to portray Ella Baker, a grassroots leader of the Civil Rights Movement. She had a 50-year career pursuing civil rights and human rights working for such venerable organizations as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) among others. She fiercely believed in the inclusion, participation, and leadership abilities of all people in the freedom movement, including the poor and uneducated, women, and young people. She believed that strong people do not need strong leaders. She once stated: "oppressed people, whatever their level of formal education, have the ability to understand and interpret the world around them, to see the world for what it is, and move to transform it." Zelda co-founded the performing arts company "Cause It's Art." Book recommendations and presentation are posted at the "Zoom Links and Resources" page of this website.
