<strong>Tom Rogers</strong> and <strong>Shelley Douglass</strong> of Ground Zero Center for Nonviolent Action presented on the history and mission of Ground Zero, the story of the Peace Pagoda, and the current state of nuclear weapons in the United States and the world. Tom served in the Navy for 32 years as a submarine officer, on both ballistic missile and attack submarines. He developed opposition to a national security policy based on nuclear weapons late in his Navy career after the end of the Cold War. After retirement from the Navy, he joined Ground Zero Center for Nonviolent Action and has worked for nuclear weapons abolition for the last 18 years. Shelley Douglass holds a BA from the University of Wisconsin and an MTS from Spring Hill College.  She has been active in movements for peace and justice since the early 1960s and was a founding member of the Pacific Life community and then of Ground Zero Center for Nonviolent Action. She moved withJim Douglass, her husband, to Birmingham, AL to continue tracking the Nuclear Train to Kings Bay, GA.  After the Nuclear Train had been stopped, they remained in Birmingham and founded Mary's House Catholic Worker, a home for families experiencing homelessness, and a base for peace and justice activities. Book and film recommendations are posted on the "Zoom Videos and Resources" page as is the video of their presentation.
