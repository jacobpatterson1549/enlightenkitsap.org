<strong>USAF Lt Col (ret) Jacqueline Chang</strong>, discussed the alliance between the Republic of Korea and the United States and how they worked together over the years to address the dictators of North Korea. She was an aircraft and munitions maintenance officer and later was awarded her secondary specialty as a Northeast Asia Foreign Area Officer. She earned recognition from the Air Force Academy Institute of National Security Studies for her master's thesis on "Politics of North Korean Refugees and Regional Security Implications." She served in the United Nations Command Military Armistice Commission as an Exercise and Plans Officer, Senior Analyst, and served on the U.S. Embassy team in Seoul, Korea, as the Chief of the Security Cooperation Operations Division of the Joint U.S. Military Affairs Group, where she oversaw the foreign military sales and scientist exchange programs for the Korean Government. While in Korea, she developed a passion for Korean film and how North Korean refugees portrayed in Korean films increased awareness of social issues and increased compassion towards the North Korean people. She became fascinated by the power of storytelling in building bridges between communities and is now pursuing writing and screenwriting full time as her passion. Book and film recommendations are posted at the "Zoom Videos and Resources" page.
