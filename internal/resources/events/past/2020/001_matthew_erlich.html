In this year that marks the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi concentration camps, <strong>Matthew Erlich</strong> of the Holocaust Center for Humanity, presented to Enl!ghten. He spoke of his mother's, Felicia's, remarkable story of strength and survival during the Nazi occupation of Poland and of her years imprisoned at Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen. In audio clips, Felicia spoke of her life in the concentration camps. Her tenacity, kindness from a German nurse, and support from her cousin when she was stricken with typhus, were factors that contributed to her survival. January 27 is designated by the United Nations General Assembly as International Holocaust Remembrance Day. Since 2005, the UN and its member states have held commemoration ceremonies to mark the anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau. On this annual day of commemoration, the UN urges every member state to honor the six million Jewish victims of the Holocaust and millions of other victims of Nazism and to develop educational programs to help prevent future genocides.
