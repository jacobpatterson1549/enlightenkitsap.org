<strong>Denise Frey</strong>, Executive Director of <strong>YWCA Kitsap County</strong>, discussed the intersection of domestic violence and homelessness and the collaboration of YWCA and the <strong>Poulsbo Rotary Club</strong> to develop <strong>Morrow Manor</strong> "a long term supportive housing project In Poulsbo. A supportive, safe place to call home allows survivors and their children the opportunity to establish and accomplish goals, and achieve an economically and emotionally secure life. While emergency services such as the ALIVE Shelter address the immediate need for safe housing with average stays of 65 days, long term housing like Morrow Manor (www.supportmorrowmanor.org) allows survivors and their family to receive housing and supportive services up to six years, if needed. Denise's power point presentation will be posted on our website under "Links and Resources."
