<p>To our Enl!ghten audience. I'm having technical difficulties with the zoom videos page. The videos are on the admin site of our website, but the video links from the last year and a half along with resource recommendations are missing on our public site. Am working on this. Meanwhile, to access our videos, type: youtube Barbara Boas in a search engine and that should bring you to our library of Enl!ghten videos. Thanks!</p>
<p>Events are free and held on the third Friday of each month except August and December. In-person events are located at St. Paul's Episcopal Church at 700 Callahan Drive in Bremerton. Sign-in begins at 6:00, with introductions at 6:30. Zoom link will be posted here the morning of the event.</p>
<p><strong>November 17, 2023 - Madrona Trails Park</strong>: Hear the story of how an overgrown and trashed Forested Park in Bremerton, was reinvigorated and restored in 2020 during the pandemic by a group of volunteers. Former Kitsap Sun reporter <strong>Josh Farley</strong> will explain how this gem of a park also contains Rich NW flora and fauna but is under threat due to climate change.</p>
<p><strong>To be rescheduled - One Heart Wild Education Sanctuary.</strong> This organization is dedicated to advancing human understanding of Trans-species Psychology and to using their knowledge of it to improve the health and well-being of their clients. Their sanctuary is not only designed for client services, but also for the needs of the non-human animals that live there. They consider advocacy for the humane treatment of animals and responsible environmental stewardship to be essential parts of their organizational mission. Their educational programs include elementary school presentations on animals and empathy, and event speaker presentations on our therapy services and educational programs, and other topics.</p>
